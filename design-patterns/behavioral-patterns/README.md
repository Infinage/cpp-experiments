### Behavioral Design Patterns

These patterns focus on communication between objects and encapsulating behavior in an effective and reusable way.

---

1. **`chain-of-responsibility.cpp`**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one of them handles the request.  

2. **`command.cpp`**: Encapsulates requests as objects, allowing parameterization, queuing, and undo operations.  

3. **`interpreter.cpp`**: Defines a way to evaluate grammar or expressions for a given context.  

4. **`iterator.cpp`**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.  

5. **`mediator.cpp`**: Centralizes communication between components, reducing coupling.  

6. **`momento.cpp`**: Captures and restores the state of an object without revealing its implementation.  

7. **`observer.cpp`**: Defines a dependency between objects so that one object changes state, all its dependents are notified automatically.  

8. **`state.cpp`**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.  

9. **`strategy.cpp`**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.  

10. **`template.cpp`**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to override specific steps.  

11. **`visitor.cpp`**: Separates an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates, enabling new operations without modifying the structure.
