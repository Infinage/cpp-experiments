### Creational Design Patterns

These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility and reusability in software design.

---

1. **`abstract-factory.cpp`**: Defines an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  

2. **`builder.cpp`**: Constructs complex objects step by step, separating the construction process from the representation.

3. **`factory.cpp`**: Encapsulates the object creation process, allowing the creation of objects without specifying their exact class.

4. **`prototype.cpp`**: Enables cloning of objects, allowing new objects to be created by copying an existing instance without altering its structure.

5. **`singleton.cpp`**: Ensures that a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to it.
