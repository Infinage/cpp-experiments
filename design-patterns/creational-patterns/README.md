### Creational Design Patterns

This folder contains C++ implementations of the **Creational Design Patterns**. These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility and reusability in software design. Below is a brief description of each file:

---

1. **`abstract-factory.cpp`**  
   Implements the **Abstract Factory Pattern**, a design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

2. **`builder.cpp`**  
   Demonstrates the **Builder Pattern**, which constructs complex objects step by step, separating the construction process from the representation.

3. **`factory.cpp`**  
   Explores the **Factory Pattern**, a method for creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object being created.

4. **`prototype.cpp`**  
   Implements the **Prototype Pattern**, which allows cloning of objects, enabling creation of new objects based on an existing instance without altering its structure.

5. **`singleton.cpp`**  
   Implements the **Singleton Pattern**, ensuring that a class has only one instance while providing a global point of access to it.
