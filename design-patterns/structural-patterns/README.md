### Structural Design Patterns

These patterns focus on organizing classes and objects to form larger structures while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

---

1. **`adapter.cpp`**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.  

2. **`bridge.cpp`**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.  

3. **`composite.cpp`**: Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.  

4. **`decorator.cpp`**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically without modifying their class.  

5. **`facade.cpp`**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.  

6. **`flyweight.cpp`**: Reduces memory usage by sharing common state among similar objects.  

7. **`proxy.cpp`**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
